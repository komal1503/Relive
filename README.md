# Inspiration:

As nowadays many people are going through depression and stress and they need someone whom they can talk and share their thoughts. So we made this platform where they can freely write about themselves and save their memories and store them for future reference. Apart from that they can also save any image and video of them too. Basically this project is based on someone's healthcare by providing them with a companion whom they can trust.

# The problem it solves:

Relive is a platform where anybody can store their good bad memories, and relive them in the future.
In the past social media, applications were built to share your experience and memories with everyone but Nowadays social media are the platform of show-off rather than sharing our experiences, hence it lost its original meaning.
Relive solve this by allowing you to store memories and only share them with others if you want to.
This allows people to store their memories without have fear of being judged.
 
1)Reduce depression and stress.

2)More secure place to save the memories.

3)Memories can be stored with a proper arrangement.

4)Allows people to store their memories without have fear of being judged

# Challenges we faced:
The most difficult challenge we face is to store memories in an efficient manner, we wanted to extract the memories from the database and sort them Datewise. The other challenging part for us to build the UI in a way that depicts nostalgia, we wanted users to feel that we have come in his/her past and relive their experiences and memories.

# Technologies used:
React, Node, Express,MongoDB,Figma

* Figma: 
We used Figma to design our pages and the layout that we had planned during our brainstorming phase.

* Front-end development using React

# Accomplishment:
We are proud that we were able to address such an important issue and find a practical and inclusive solution to it. Our team work and cooperative workflow helped us to build the project in its entirety. We are proud to have completed the whole UI design, develop and publish a fully functional website.
 
# Learning Achievements:
